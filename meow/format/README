this library was heavily inspired by FastFormat: http://fastformat.org/
but has a number of important differences

+ healder-only, no need to compile/link to a library
+ doesn't require any sort of build process at all, format functions are generated with macros
+ uses traits instead of plain functions to facilitate extencibility, therefore
	* has no problems with gcc namespace visibility
	* more flexible: supports enable_if for all metafunctions
	* allows any order of include declarations to be used
+ supports any character type as well as mixing different ones in same translation unit
	(this is not fully tested for non plain 'char'-s and obviously has bugs)

+ has slightly different behaviour in some aspects
	* not throwing exceptions if not all args are used by the format
	* etc.

+/- trades a dependency on STLSOFT for a dependency on BOOST
	(even though a minor one, we depend on type_traits and preprocessor)
	it's a different approach really
	fastformat is a standalone lib with an external dependency
	meow.format is a one-of-many library in meow suite

- lacks some features
	* no expression cache
	* no "write" api (this will probably be added in the future)
	* no width/alighment syntax like {arg_id, full_with, field_width, alignment}
	* something else i didn't dig too deep into
	* documentation (weeee, gotta write that, but you know....)
